# Shape to Fabrication 2025 - Workshop Script to Deploy

A workshop to be presented on Tuesday April 15th, 2025 for Shape to Fabrication 2025

This workshop will introduce the Rhino 8 Script Editor, a new integrated development environment for Rhino 8. You will learn how to code a command in Python or C#, implement a Grasshopper component, create a Rhino ScriptEditor project and build a Rhino plug-in and Grasshopper add-in, all without leaving the new Script Editor.
